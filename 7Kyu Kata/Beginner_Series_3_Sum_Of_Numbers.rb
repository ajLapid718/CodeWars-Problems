# Given two integers, which can be positive and negative, find the sum of all the numbers between including them too and return it. If both numbers are equal return a or b.
#
# Note! a and b are not ordered!
#
# Example:
# get_sum(1, 0) == 1   # 1 + 0 = 1
# get_sum(1, 2) == 3   # 1 + 2 = 3
# get_sum(0, 1) == 1   # 0 + 1 = 1
# get_sum(1, 1) == 1   # 1 Since both are same
# get_sum(-1, 0) == -1 # -1 + 0 = -1
# get_sum(-1, 2) == 2  # -1 + 0 + 1 + 2 = 2
# Waiting for the Feedback! Thanks!

def get_sum(a,b)
  lower_bound = [a,b].min
  upper_bound = [a,b].max

  (lower_bound..upper_bound).reduce(:+)
