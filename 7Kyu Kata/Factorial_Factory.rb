# In mathematics, the factorial of integer 'n' is written as 'n!'. It is equal to the product of n and every integer preceding it. For example: 5! = 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 x 5 = 120
#
# Your mission is simple: write a function that takes an integer 'n' and returns 'n!'.
#
# You are guaranteed an integer argument. For any values outside the positive range, return null, nil or None .
#
# Note: 0! is always equal to 1. Negative values should return null;

  return 1 if n == 0
  return 1 if n == 1
  facts = factorial(n-1) * (n)
