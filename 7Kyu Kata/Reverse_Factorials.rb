# I'm sure you're familiar with factorials â€“ that is, the product of an integer and all the integers below it.
#
# For example, 5! = 120, as 5*4*3*2*1 = 120.
#
# Your challenge is to create a function that takes any number and returns the number that it is a factorial of. So, your function would take in 120 and return 5!.
#
# Of course, not every number is a factorial of another. In this case, your function would return 'None'.
#
# So, 120 will return 5! 24 will return 4! 150 will return 'None'.

  target = 1

  product = 1
  target = 1
